# University-Site

This Project is a what a Univeristy Site could look like. 
It does not refere to a certain Univeristy is just a design i found on YT and thought to recreate. 

Has five main components in the html.
    
    1. Home 
    2. About
    3. Course
    4. Blog
    5. Contact 
The Css part is desinged to be repsonsive, meaning that it will look just as fine if it was opened from a mobile. 
 
 - Below you will find some parts on how this project turned out. As you might have noticed the data and information are not filled because that was not the 
 point of this project but rather just to learn how to display diffrent tags on Html and style them responsivly with Css. I hope y'all enjoy it as much as I did. â™¥
